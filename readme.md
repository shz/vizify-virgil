# Vizify - Virgil

This library contains the Virgil interface/implementation of the Vizify
platform.  You probably won't need to include this library directly, as
it's included for you by the [Vizify tool](https://git.corp.yahoo.com/vizify/tool).

## Documentation

Full documentation on how to create a card and all that jazz will live
somewhere else, once it's written.  The docs here focus more on how to
use the various components of the Vizify platform.

Most of the components have a bit of interplay, but they're all useful
on their own.  Here are the docs for the individual components:

 * [Animation](docs/animation.md)
 * [Color](docs/color.md)
 * [JSON](docs/json.md)

More unified docs forthcoming.
